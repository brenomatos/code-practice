# Code Practice
Repository for various code pratices. Initially, graph algorithms. Maybe data structures later

# Input

All graph algorithms will receive a graph file as a command line argument.
They will follow the edge list input style, such as:
```
3 4
1 2 1
2 1 2
3 1 3
2 3 2
```
The first line will disclose number of vertices v and edges e, respectively. The
next e lines will disclose the edges of the graph.
