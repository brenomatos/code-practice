# Code Practice
Repository for various code pratices. Initially, graph algorithms. Maybe data structures later

# Input

All graph algorithms will receive a graph file as a standard input.
They will follow the edge list input style, such as:
```
3 4
1 2 1
2 1 2
3 1 3
2 3 2
```
The first line will disclose number of vertices v and edges e, respectively. The
next e lines will disclose the edges of the graph.  

# Compiling
All programs must be compiled as follows:
```
g++ -std=c++11 program.cpp
```
# Algorithms
The graph algorithms I intend to implement here are the following:
* BFS
* DFS (✔)
* Prim
* Kruskal
* Floyd-Warshall (✔)
* Dijkstra
* Hierholzer
* 2SAT
* Bellman-Ford
* Blossom
* Kosajaru
* Ford-Fulkerson
